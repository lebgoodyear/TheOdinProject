        <!-- The 'noopener' value below stops the opened link from gaining access to the original webpage. This helps preventing phishing
        attacks, where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one ('tabnabbing').
        
        The 'norefferer' value below stops the opened link from knowing that your webpage has a link to to it. 'noopener' behaviour is included in
        'noreferrer' so using 'noreferrer' alone is sufficient. -->
